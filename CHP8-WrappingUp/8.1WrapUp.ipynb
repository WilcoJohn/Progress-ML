    "Most machine learning packages provide predefined machine learning models that apply one particular algorithm. However, many real-world problems have a particular structure that, when properly incorporated into the model, can yield much betterperforming predictions. Often, the structure of a particular problem can be expressed using the language of probability theory. Such structure commonly arises from having a mathematical model of the situation for which you want to predict. To understand what we mean by a structured problem, consider the following example. Let’s say you want to build a mobile application that provides a very detailed position estimate in an outdoor space, to help users navigate a historical site. A mobile phone provides many sensors to help you get precise location measurements, like the GPS, accelerometer, and compass. You also have an exact map of the area. This problem is highly structured. You know where the paths and points of interest are from your map. You also have rough positions from the GPS, and the accelerometer and compass in the user’s device provide you with very precise relative measurements. But throwing these all together into a black-box machine learning system to predict positions might not be the best idea. This would throw away all the information you already know about how the real world works. If the compass and accelerometer tell you a user is going north, and the GPS is telling you the user is going south, you probably can’t trust the GPS. If your position estimate tells you the user just walked through a wall, you should also be highly skeptical. It’s possible to express this situation using a probabilistic model, and then use machine learning or probabilistic inference to find out how much you should trust each measurement, and to reason about what the best guess for the location of a user is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve expressed the situation and your model of how the different factors work together in the right way, there are methods to compute the predictions using these custom models directly. The most general of these methods are called probabilistic programming languages, and they provide a very elegant and compact way to express a learning problem. Examples of popular probabilistic programming languages are PyMC (which can be used in Python) and Stan (a framework that can be used from several languages, including Python). While these packages require some understanding of probability theory, they simplify the creation of new models significantly"
